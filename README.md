# Running-data
Fun accountability project to track my running stats

Data Collection | 
I use Apple fitness running to track my runs to easily export data. In the past I have preferred the UI of Nike Running Club more for the ease of in-app tracking but exporting it to chart the data on my own seemed tedious.

Data Export | 
The export function in Apple Fitness creates an XML file. For the ease of using a CSV, I use the app Health Auto Exprt - JSON/CSV by Lybron Sobers
